## What is low carb diet?

A low-carb diet means you eat whole foods natural proteins, fats and vegetables instead of sugary foods, pasta and white bread.

A low-carb diet means that you eat fewer carbohydrates and a higher proportion of fat. This can also be called a low-carb, high-fat diet (LCHF) or a keto diet.

For decades we’ve been told that fat is detrimental to our health. Meanwhile low-fat "diet" products, often full of sugar, have flooded supermarket shelves. This has likely been a major mistake, that coincided with the start of the obesity epidemic.5
While this doesn’t prove causation, it’s clear the low-fat message didn’t prevent the obesity increase, and it is possible it contributed.

Studies now show that there’s no reason to fear natural fats.6
Instead, on a low-carb diet fat is your friend. Simply minimize your intake of sugar and starches and you can eat all the fat you need to feel satisfied.7

When you avoid sugar and starches, your blood sugar tends to stabilize and the levels of the fat-storing hormone insulin drop.8
This helps increases fat burning and makes you feel more satiated, thereby naturally reducing food intake and promoting weight loss.9

Studies show that a low-carb diet can make it easier to lose weight and to control your blood sugar, among other benefits.10
The basics

    Eat: Meat, fish, eggs, vegetables growing above ground and natural fats (like butter).
    Avoid: Sugar and starchy foods (like bread, pasta, rice, beans and potatoes).

Eat when you’re hungry and stop when you’re satisfied. It can be that simple. You do not need to count calories or weigh your food.11
 You don’t need low-fat products.12

Who should NOT do a strict low-carb diet?

Most people can safely start a low-carb diet.13
But in these three situations you may need some preparation or adaptation:

    Are you taking medication for diabetes, e.g. insulin? Learn more
    Are you taking medication for high blood pressure? Learn more
    Are you currently breastfeeding? Learn more

If you’re not in any of these groups, and don’t have other severe chronic medical conditions, you’re good to go!
Disclaimer: While a low-carb diet has many proven benefits, it’s still controversial. The main potential danger regards medications, especially for diabetes, where doses may need to be adapted (see above). Discuss any changes in medication and relevant lifestyle changes with your doctor. Full disclaimer

This guide is written for adults with health issues, including obesity, that could benefit from a low-carb diet.

Low-carb diet foods: Natural fats (butter, olive oil); Meat; Fish and seafood; Eggs; Cheese; Vegetables that grow above ground
 
The numbers above are grams of digestible carbs per 100 grams (3.5 ounces). Fiber is not counted, you can eat all the fiber you want.14

How low carb is a low-carb diet?

The lower your carbohydrate intake, the more powerful the effects on weight and blood sugar appear to be.17
For that reason we recommend initially following the dietary advice fairly strictly. When you’re happy with your weight and health, you may carefully try eating more carbs if you want to (although we find many people don’t want to).

Here are three examples of what a low-carb meal can look like, depending on how many carbs you plan to eat per day:
Ketogenic low carbKetogenic 0-20
moderate low carbModerate 20-50
Liberal low carbLiberal 50-100

 
 
A strict low-carb diet is often called a keto or ketogenic diet. It’s not a no-carb diet, but it contains less than 20 grams of carbs per day.
